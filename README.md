# SpaceCAD

## Introduction

SpaceCAD is a simple MDT/CAD system I am creating that can be used by GTA RP servers. This system is completely free to use if self-hosted. There may (or may not be) a cloud hosted version later on in development.

## Pull Requests/Issues

Please feel free to make pull requests and create issues. If you feel there are ways for me to improve the code, I am always happy to look at what others think will work better!
